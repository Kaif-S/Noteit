# Note it

This note-taking app is built with Flask and Bootstrap 5 components, featuring basic functionality. I opted for a text-based system to avoid the hassle of creating and connecting to a database.

# For storing data

I have created basic csv file like structure called `database.txt`, updating it with `os` library of python.
